Behringer B-Control Deejay BCD 3000
===================================

  - `Manufacturer's page <https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0758>`__

By default, the input channels 1-2 use the RCA phono inputs for the
source signal. On Windows, this can be switched to the microphone in the
ASIO driver control panel. On GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, `a particular MIDI
message must be sent <https://mixxx.discourse.group/t/mixxx-bcd3000-mic-port-is-not-work/16008>`
to switch channels 1-2 to the microphone input.
